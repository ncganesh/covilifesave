**PROBLEM**

India is currently in the midst of an unprecedented public health emergency with sudden spike in new COVID-19 cases and 
people are dying due to the acute shortage of **hospital beds,oxygen cylinders,Remedesvier Injection** throughout the country.
So there are million of tweets posted related to Requests,Medical help,Medical products on twitter.

**SOLUTION**
The main goal of this project is to build a system that will help the Emergency Management System/People Offering  to get related specific tweets that will save lives.

The proposed system has 3 platforms:
Twitter Intents/Insights : network grap 
  (2) Provide/Offer Help (Automated Tweet Classification): Automated classification component classifies each tweet to 35 crisis related categories. The categories include but not limited to request, offer, medical help, medical products, and transport. This categorization is made possible by learning a model using machine learning algorithms on the text of the tweet. 
    
    (3) Semantic Search - Semantic search provides the user the control to search for relevant tweets by querying the Twitter stream through textual input. In addition to these two components, we also provide the user the ability to see and filter by the origin location of tweets. Through this semantic search we will also be able to narrow down scams and spam tweets.

# Demo-Preview

<!-- Add a demo for your project -->

<!-- After you have written about your project, it is a good idea to have a demo/preview(**video/gif/screenshots** are good options) of your project so that people can know what to expect in your project. You could also add the demo in the previous section with the product description.

Here is a random GIF as a placeholder.

# Table of contents

<!-- After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README. -->

- [Project Title](#project-title)
- [Demo-Preview](#demo-preview)
- [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Development](#development)
- [Footer](#footer)

# Installation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- *You might have noticed the **Back to top** button(if not, please notice, it's right there!). This is a good idea because it makes your README **easy to navigate.*** 

The first one should be how to install(how to generally use your project or set-up for editing in their machine).

This should give the users a concrete idea with instructions on how they can use your project repo with all the steps.

Following this steps, **they should be able to run this in their device.**

A method I use is after completing the README, I go through the instructions from scratch and check if it is working. -->

<!-- Here is a sample instruction:

To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:

```git init```

``` -->

# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- This is optional and it is used to give the user info on how to use the project after installation. This could be added in the Installation section also. -->

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- This is the place where you give instructions to developers on how to modify the code.

You could give **instructions in depth** of **how the code works** and how everything is put together.

You could also give specific instructions to how they can setup their development environment.

Ideally, you should keep the README simple. If you need to add more complex explanations, use a wiki. Check out [this wiki](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/wiki) for inspiration. -->

# Contribute
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- This is where you can let people know how they can **contribute** to your project. Some of the ways are given below.

Also this shows how you can add subsections within a section. -->



# Footer
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- Let's also add a footer because I love footers and also you **can** use this to convey important info.

Let's make it an image because by now you have realised that multimedia in images == cool(*please notice the subtle programming joke). -->

Leave a star in GitHub, give a clap in Medium and share this guide if you found this helpful.

<!-- Add the footer here -->
