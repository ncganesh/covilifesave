**SOLUTION**
The main goal of this project is to build a system that will help the Emergency Management System/People Offering  to get related specific tweets that will save lives.

The proposed system has 3 platforms:
Twitter Intents/Insights : network grap 
  (2) Provide/Offer Help (Automated Tweet Classification): Automated classification component classifies each tweet to 35 crisis related categories. The categories include but not limited to request, offer, medical help, medical products, and transport. This categorization is made possible by learning a model using machine learning algorithms on the text of the tweet. 
    
    (3) Semantic Search - Semantic search provides the user the control to search for relevant tweets by querying the Twitter stream through textual input. In addition to these two components, we also provide the user the ability to see and filter by the origin location of tweets. Through this semantic search we will also be able to narrow down scams and spam tweets.
